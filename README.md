# Python Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a beginner-friendly Python project: a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Itâ€™s designed to reinforce foundational Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, input handling, and random number generation.

## Features
- Allows users to:
  - Play **Rock, Paper, Scissors** against the computer.
  - Quit the game at any time by typing `quit`.
  - Get immediate feedback on game outcomes (win, lose, tie).
- Includes input validation to handle invalid entries.
- Demonstrates key Python concepts:
  - **Loops**: Use of `while` to enable continuous gameplay.
  - **Random module**: Randomly selecting the computer's choice.
  - **Conditional statements**: Determining game logic and outcomes.
  - **Input handling**: Capturing and processing user input.
  - **String manipulation**: Normalizing input to make it case-insensitive.

## What I Learned
- Deepened understanding of Python fundamentals, including:
  - How to use the `random` module to generate random choices.
  - Leveraging `if-elif-else` statements for logic flow.
  - Implementing user input validation with the `in` operator.
  - Using loops to build interactive applications.
  - Dynamic string formatting with f-strings for better user feedback.
  
## Example Gameplay
```text
Choose - Rock, Paper, or Scissors: rock
Computer chose: scissors
You win!

Choose - Rock, Paper, or Scissors: paper
Computer chose: rock
You win!

Choose - Rock, Paper, or Scissors: quit
```

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.9+** installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://python.org).
2. Save the `python_101_project.py` file on your computer.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
5. Run the program using the command:
